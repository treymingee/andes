ANDES is an open-source Python library for power system modeling, computation,
analysis, and control. It supports power flows calculation, transient stability
simulation, and small-signal stability analysis for transmission systems. ANDES
implements a symbolic-numeric framework for rapid prototyping of
differential-algebraic equation-based models. In this framework, a comprehensive
:ref:`library of models <modelref>` is developed, including the full
second-generation renewable models. Models in ANDES have been :ref:`verified
<verification>` with commercial software.

..
    ANDES has high computational performance and is close to that of commercial
    tools. It is compatible with a variety of :ref:`input data formats
    <input-formats>`, including PSS/E, MATPOWER, and Excel. Model documentation is
    generated using symbolic equations, ensuring that it is always current with the
    latest development.

    Model development guide
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Looking to implement new models, algorithms and functionalities in ANDES?
    The development guide provides in-depth information on the design
    philosophy, data structure, and implementation of the hybrid
    symbolic-numeric framework.

    API reference
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The API reference contains a detailed description of the ANDES package. The
    reference describes how the methods work and which parameters can be used.
    It assumes that you have an understanding of the key concepts.
